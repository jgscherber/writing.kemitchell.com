I'm going to try hosting regular office hours where anyone can call in and ask questions, including legal questions in my field.  Think [legal clinic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_clinic), but completely public.

The first session will be Friday, February 3, 2023 at 6:00 PM UTC, which is Friday, February 3, 2023 at 10:00 AM California time.  More details---and an Atom feed for new sessions---at [officehours.kemitchell.com](https://officehours.kemitchell.com).

Special thanks to [Mike Perham](https://www.mikeperham.com/) for inspiration and tips.

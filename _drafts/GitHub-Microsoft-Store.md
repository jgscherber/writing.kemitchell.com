GitHub launched a software marketplace five years ago...[for GitHub integrations](https://github.blog/2017-05-22-introducing-github-marketplace-and-more-tools-to-customize-your-workflow/).  A month later, they hosted the first [Sustain](https://sustainoss.org/assets/pdf/SustainOSS-west-2017-report.pdf).  After two years, [joining the Borg](https://news.microsoft.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-to-acquire-github-for-7-5-billion/), and another Sustain, they didn't open Marketplace to the rest of software as we know it.  They [first-partied donations](https://github.blog/2019-05-23-announcing-github-sponsors-a-new-way-to-contribute-to-open-source/), then literally threw [free](https://docs.github.com/en/sponsors/getting-started-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors#about-the-github-sponsors-matching-fund) [money](https://docs.github.com/en/sponsors/getting-started-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors#about-github-sponsors) at it, to close the [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com)-[Open Collective](https://www.opencollective.com) gap.

For what GitHub does, there's a market.  For what we do on GitHub, a tip jar.

Donations, in a word, are weak.  They excel in just one way: offending almost no one.   As long as you don't beg too often.  As long as you don't beg too loud.

GitHub does donation as a button with a heart on it.  The button resides in a sidebar, often below the fold.  The button is gray.  Very weak.  Very safe.

Even with optimized appeals and big, shiny "calls to action", tips brings less than payments for good or service.  So it takes a much bigger audience to yield to make meaningful cash.  So fewer people do.  This is a problem when competing as a platform means showing off successes.

Owning distribution, GitHub can mint new celebrities.  Celebrity increases audience, which helps low-yield donations add up.  Of course, successful celebrities also promote the platform.  Careful choice of stars and starlets can bolster its image.  But there can only be so many.  If everyone's famous, even just coder-famous, then no one is.

Like the patronage platforms it cloned, GitHub Sponsors quietly morphs into a market.  The lead offering is ads, in the form of logo placements.  Largely in `README` and on Pages sites, where they [tend less to offend](https://feross.org/funding-experiment-recap/).  But wherever perks of sponsorship overlap with open expectations---access to code, availability of support, roadmap steering---they're hidden from view.  [Paid private repos.

Microsoft paid $7.5 billion for the hub of public software distribution and development.  They want to be the payment rail of public software, too.  But money for the kind of software GitHub hosts remains stubbornly verboten.  What's a platform preaching open source to do?  [Integrate with the Microsoft Store?](https://www.pcgamer.com/microsoft-store-u-turn-open-source/)

There's no legal, technical, or business reason not to.  Just a conceptual one.  Which is to say, not much of one.

[It's already begun.](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/libreoffice/9PB80DCFP83W)  But perhaps also too late?

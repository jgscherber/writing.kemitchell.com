(Note: This is a translation from the [original German](https://felixreda.eu/2021/07/github-copilot-is-not-infringing-your-copyright/), which I cannot read.)

- Straw Man: Free Software people calling for copyright to cover _this_ isn't the same as calling for copyright to cover literally everything. Slippery Slope.
- "Wouldn't need GPL if copyright law were such-and-such"
  - no copyright: totally unrealistic
  - no accounting for alternatives, such as keeping code secret, using compilation and obfuscation
- strengthening copyright strengthens more numerous restrictive licenses
- > In the US, scraping falls under fair use, this has been clear at least since the Google Books case.
- > reproduces short snippets
  - not just!
- > precisely this problematic demand [of press publishers] that the Free Software community endorses
  - where?
  - not the same
  - we can and do create different rules for copyrights within different domains and industries
- > based on the assumption that a machine can produce works
  - It's GitHub <em>Co</em>pilot
  - when the tech is new and whiz-bang, we tend to ignore the operator

Open licenses for software almost always say that if you share a copy of the software with anyone else, you have to share a copy of the copyright notice and license terms along with it.  When the vast majority of these licenses were thought up, "software distribution" meant copying software to physical media and shipping it in the mail.  Later licenses continue to support [sneakernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet) distribution.

There was no singular, worldwide, consumer-accessible network software distributors could point to, instead of making copies of terms and copyright notices.  There is now.

title: Software is Service is Software Again
---

A software-as-a-service startup is after a big sale.  They've racked up the usual certifications, done the GDPR dance, but the customer's invested literally millions in security and compliance.  The server room at customer HQ still has some big iron, for accounting.  But they signed their own cloud deal of late, and that is the future.  The data's highly regulated, and they're loathe to let it out of their hands.

The deal mutates back from "cloud" to "on-prem".  But the "prem" isn't the customer's, but Amazon's.  It's going to run on the new "private cloud".  This perturbs the startup.  Are they going to stand responsible for code they aren't actually running?  But there's a ray of hope: The customer's cloud is the same theirs.  It's AWS all the way down, on both sides.

Have the customer create a subaccount.   The custom will run the app there.  The customer will pay the bill.  The startup will promise to keep costs down.  But the internal security-compliance apparatus still quivers.  On comes the onerous stack of personnel policies for system access.  On come the rules about antivirus on every device.  The startup reluctantly agrees, but the guardians remain unsatisfied.

A final flash of inspiration: The startup has automated deployment, of course.  Kubernetes.  Let them hand over deployment configuration, in addition to deployed code.  Uptime can be assured as usual.  Response time will hardly differ.  Technical support can proceed as normal, with a few allowances for getting them relevant logs.

The deal advances to the customer's procurement.  The startup's sales gets a contract back by e-mail, sends it along to their lawyer.  Their lawyer fires up Microsoft Word.  It's not just a generic "master services agreement".  It's software-specific.

What's the title in bold at the top of page one?

There's no telling.

For customers that've spent the last ten years buying "Software as a Service", the form is like a service one.  "Cloud Services Agreement", "Master Software as a Service Agreement", something like that.  But substantial chunks of it will simply fail to describe the deal actually at hand.  The vendor isn't running the servers.  The vendor doesn't have access to the data.

For customers stuck somewhat behind, the form is likely a license agreement.  Or, frankly, a license agreement retitled as a cloud agreement, but not actually revised much.  The long sections devoted to granting software licenses are unintentionally apt here.  Vendor delivering and licensing software is actually what's going on.  But little will likely be said about uptime, response time, and so on.

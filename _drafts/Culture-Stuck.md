Fitzgerald [wrote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crack-Up) "the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function".  Orwell [dubbed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four) the same thing doublethink---"to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them".  The Fitzgerald persists because it flatters.  The Orwell persists because it sticks and stays.

I know that open source is the exception, herald of a new rule.  It shows and tells everyone, before and since, how to be one with the Web.  ["Wikinomics"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikinomics) for the C-suite.  ["Commons-based peer production"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Networks) for the faculty lounge.  ["Bazaar"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar) for squinting hackers.  A [White Elephant sale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant) for the masses, where money never changes hands.  Exceptionalism for one and all, [because the Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Declaration_of_the_Independence_of_Cyberspace).

But at the same time, traipsing about the Web, I see software acting just like everything else.  The same money models.  The same marketing tactics.  The same idealist debates to nowhere.  A parallel bevy of brawling platforms, app stores, and marketplaces, all trying quietly to off each, without scaring off the users.  If I could find my memory-reset switch and start again, I'm not sure I'd see a difference.  Except for all the old-timers, including me, telling themselves that software is different.

Software in general, and open source in particular, has matured its relationship with money despite itself.  What it does in practice has run far ahead of the old stories it still tells about itself.

Coders of the '90s and 2000s brought software dist and dev online.  Open source gave them a story, jargon, heroes, allies, and enemies---a way to see the software world.  They won some recognition.  But their program left funding and payoff to industry and the academy.  They made their money in meatspace, when they needed to make money at all.

The early Web did not do payments.  It barely did access control.  Naturally, its conjoined ideology, freedom of information, made gating access or permission on payment taboo.  Gating software meant preventing copies, handling money, or both.  Either was awkward or impossible in practice.  So open source them unnecessary.

Even with PayPal, eBay, Amazon, and Transport Layer Security in the late 1990s, it took years for Americans to trust their money to the Net.  Open source, like the Web that coevolved it, moved furthest and spread fastest by leveraging what it had as it shipped.  This was the land-grab stage, for installed base and mindshare.  Feature fights came later.

We're well past that now.  Today's Internet people grow up on a more complete Web.  It does a lot more, for a whole lot more people.  Public calls to pay are as common online as in real life.

It's not just ads, like in the early days.  The very words "platform" and "marketplace" are merging.  If you make stuff on the Internet for others today, chances are good your distributor also wants to be your payment processor.  They pave a path for going pro.  They often facilitate segmenting free from premium, then "monetizing" one or both.

Then there's open source.  The paved path for open source is an off-ramp: go make money doing something, anything, else.  One rule for the Internet, and another for software.  And not even all of software.

Even software components around older industries, like games, music, or manufacturing, don't suffer this exceptionalism.  Nor, of course, do most consumer apps.  Outside open source, there's often not just a market, but competing software marketplaces, angling to bring more buyers and showcase more seller success.  The less advantaged a seller, the more appealing their story.  [Horatio Alger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Alger) again.

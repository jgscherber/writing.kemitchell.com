The open source view of software production today is right where properties-and-rents dogma stood when Netscape unleashed Mozilla: in the way of the greatest pent-up wave of programmer potential yet beheld by man.

To maximize that potential, we have to think about how software ought to be made _both_ in terms of the free flow of bits _and_ in terms of the free flow of dollars.  Not because money rules everything else around us.  Because that's what it will take to bring an order of magnitude more coding talent into service.  The "crowd" with Internet access and lots of spare time pales in comparison to the mass with Internet access who could do honest work for honest pay.

Those of us willing and able to nurse a guildsman's ideal of software production aloof from financial concern represent a small, passing aberration.  And no anointed elect lays out the welcome mat for millions of competitors.  Welcome or not, the talent will come.  Software production _will_ bend to global Internet penetration.  That is not the question.

The question is whether a prior generation's thinking, largely framed by open source agitprop arrayed against '90s incumbents, will stay humble and flexible enough to adapt to the new now, distill lasting wisdom, and pass it on.  It could very well harden into reactionary dogma instead, in which case the new talent will have to push off against it, likely repeating no few of its mistakes.  This could happen if ideas stay too rigid.  It could happen if individuals fail to cede right of way.

The question ways heavy on me, because I stand between.  I was coding in the late '90s, but my work life began in earnest only after [the crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_financial_crisis).  As a result, I looked up to, studied, and inherited from the dot-com generation, but I didn't live their experience firsthand, and had to take a lot of their points abstractly.  I'm not and never will be an "open source founding father", but at this point, nor would I want to be.

What is that good for?

## Money

Revisiting open source writing I revered from the "early days", I'm struck by just how awkwardly its big boosters danced around money.  "Open Source" overtly courted industry, but also [performatively bad-mouthed it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69ZyX5sN2NA).  "Free Software" was emphatically _not against business_, but obviously was, still is, and often gratingly so.  Money in online software dev would ruin it for everyone, but every new [open-source hire](https://www.drdobbs.com/a-conversation-with-larry-wall/184410483) was a collective dream come true.  The latest <abbr title="initial public offering">IPO</abbr> pop always [made top news](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/va-linux-smashes-ipo-record-soaring-almost-700-836955), but open source transcended capitalism, threatening to render even money-for-labor markets obsolete.

["Wikinomics"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikinomics) for the C-suite.  ["Commons-based peer production"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Networks) for the faculty lounge.  ["Bazaar"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar) for squinting hackers.  An economy without prices, production without profit, a [White Elephant sale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant) of bytes where money never changed hands.  Exceptionalism for everyone, [because the Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Declaration_of_the_Independence_of_Cyberspace).

Looking back, out of the moment, it's easy to see rationalization and self-promotion in words that felt quite profound at the time.   Big things were happening to coders and the industry.  Big things were happening fast.  We needed to feel we somehow had our heads around it.  We needed a bigger picture to place ourselves into.

"Open Source" thinking never really grappled with money because it didn't have to.  Enough people made bank---sometimes despite themselves, other times trying to seem like it---and those stories were easy to amplify.  Guys with laptops and Dreamweaver were making good money. The dot-com bubble hype machine was revving past redline.  For all involved---winners, losers, hopefuls---assuming money would never bottleneck the process made solving all the problems about how we'd make software so much simpler.  The resulting solutions were clean, and therefore felt correct, and feelings, as usual, prevailed.  The tipoff: we spent a lot of time congratulating ourselves for being very rational, scientific, &c.

The reality was "personal computing", initial consumer Internet penetration, and a relatively shallow pool of available talent, blessed by fortune with profound first-mover advantage.  Suddenly, savvy nerds in relatively affluent circumstances, plus even the _children_ of semi-affluent parents, got marginally free, fast, public distribution of software and manuals.  They used it to build free, fast, public software collaboration.  Public capital markets were eating anything called "software" right up, even when it tasted like dogfood.  Education was so far behind that four years at school could even be a hindrance, pulling the young out of the action at a critical period.  _Move fast._  Even if what you deliver is broken, people will be amazed.  And pay you for it.

In practical terms, in those early days, it was easier _not_ to charge, _not_ to throttle access, _not_ to set permissions or enforce them.  Anyone taking the time to engineer in those complications risked overtaking by a faster-moving, short-term-optimal competitor.  We live with the consequences to this day.  The Web is decades old, but authentication is still weird and awful.  Online payment was largely monopolized.  [Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu)---complete with access controls and even content royalty payments---remains trivia.  That reflects what was viable at a specific, past point in time, not any forward-thinking concept of a complete system.  We inherit much the same in our understanding.

## Billions

When open source was born, the story was "we have the Internet".  "We" was a rather select and self-selecting group of people.  That isn't the story anymore.  Cheap copies and worldwide comms aren't news.  The story today is "_everyone_ has the Internet".  More than half of humanity.  Billions.

The force that cannot be stopped in software today is the force of millions of untapped talents that could be serving others via software.  The work of networking a few thousand elect and distributing their outputs to the masses continues, but the explanation and hype that greased those wheels, twenty or thirty years ago, no longer explain, much less govern, what's happening now, or what needs to be done about it.  In the large, the mental framing of open source, or open source versus proprietary, has become a hindrance.

Unlocking mass human software potential today requires restoring the old maxim of honest work for honest pay.  We must recouple compensation and production.  No group of people is better positioned to achieve this than programmers.  We are the people who automate counting, copying, and payments.

But we are resistant to doing so.  As one of those grown-up kids whose middle-class parents brought a PC and dial-up into the home early, I am extremely sympathetic to the idea that money ruins everything online.  The 90s and early 2000s felt special, more special than now, and we were still scared to use credit cards on the Internet back then.  Correlation or causation?  Correlation or nostalgia?

As one of those grown-up kids, it's been hard to understand that for the vast majority of people now online, "money will ruin the community" isn't a feel-good callback to halcyon days of yore, but social [Catch-22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22).  Most people can't break into coding $0 software sans material support.  That door isn't open to them by default, but closed.  To let them in, we have to let money in with them.  We let them in with money.  But letting money in---or is it letting them in?---will, we say, ruin it.  So we say as credentialed members of the "community", already making enough bank to play.

It's a mass online equivalent of the swank business club downtown.  The value of the club is exclusivity.  No exclusivity, not the same club.  And the idea that the current, exclusive kind of club is the best kind to have---that software and other work online is best produced by "peers" who can afford to work for nothing or command substantial patronage---implies that defending the unsullied preserve of the few promises more than the untapped potential of the masses.  There are way fewer open-source gigs at large companies and the foundations they fund than potential open-source programmers.

This view is just one symptom of living the future in the early 2000s and falling into the past circa 2020.  There are others.  It's now easier for most people online to publish photos or even videos than code, for example.  Same for long blog posts.  Most people don't surf with physical keyboards.  Kids approach 100 wpm with three fingers on phones, with and without autocorrect.

<!-- Broad acceptance of permissive licensing made scale differences irrelevant.  Big companies could give and take from sole hackers.  The same hasn't happened for paid transactions. -->

<!-- return to old "honest pay for honest work" versus financialization, which introduces money with or (usually) without anything useful being done -->

<!-- No slippery slope to the extreme, be it proprietary licensing of financialization -->

<!-- not restricting the new online elite v. empowering the online masses (who are growing) -->

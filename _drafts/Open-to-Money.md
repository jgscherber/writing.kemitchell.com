The open source mindset in 2022 is right where proprietary mania was thirty years ago: standing in the way of the biggest rush of pent-up programmer potential yet to hit computing.  Half of humanity's online.  Millions more could contribute fundamental software.  But they'll need to earn in the open, not just work there.  They'll need an open source people pay for.

When old believers say money and open source shouldn't mix, what more and more new prospects hear is that they're cut out.  They know there's money in open source.  But they can't work for nothing, wait years to catch a break, or raise seed money or a grant to pay their bills.  If coding in the open can't pay as they go, they can't code in the open.  If some kinds of software just have to cost nothing, no matter how much they're worth, then those aren't kinds of software they can do.

Programmers who can aren't dying out, but too few realize they're no longer the story.  Toppling barriers between affluent coder can-do and source code still enables progression.  But problems arise when the battle cries of earlier, wealthier cohorts harden into dogma that holds more numerous newcomers back.  On a free and open Web, the interests of the few shouldn't spinlock the many, even if the few got there first.  If there's one ideal for doing software online, it needs to maximize global progress, not enshrine a local maximum and impose trade-offs.

Big numbers win in the end.  Coders and companies are going to pay for basic tools and components again, they're going to get their money's worth, and they're going to outcompete those who don't.  Because licensing's the step up on the business-model ladder that workaday coders can reach from entry-level global jobs.  Not just collaborating on the open Web, but finding and selling to customers there.  Not by monetizing something else, but by monetizing what they do.

Newly unblocked talent will do for languages, databases, libraries, and frameworks what offshoring, immigration, and remote work have already done for the rest of software built with them.  The potential energy of so many minds just can't be dammed up indefinitely.

Facilitating the change, rather than fighting it, is a big, unrealized opportunity for those who do have skills and spare cycles in software.  Bigger than applying known tech to one more market niche after another, startup by startup, product by product.  The software game can be improved, not just played well.

At the same time, proactively guiding this process for progress, not just leaving it to the bounty hunters of Big Tech, is a big, unappreciated political challenge.  Will the world software market be a free, open Web or a private platform under some feudal firms' pricey protection?

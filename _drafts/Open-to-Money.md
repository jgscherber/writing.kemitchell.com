The open source mindset in 2022 is right where proprietary mania was thirty years ago: standing in the way of the biggest rush of pent-up programmer potential yet to hit computing.  Half of humanity's online.  Millions more could contribute good tools, libraries, frameworks, and languages, but they'll need to earn in the open, not just work there.  They'll need an open source people pay for.  And they'll get it.

When old believers say money and open source shouldn't mix, what more and more new prospects hear is that they're not welcome.  They can't work for nothing like earlier hackers, wait years to catch a break, or raise a big grant or a seed round to pay all their bills.  If coding in the open can't pay as they go, they can't code in the open.  If some kinds of software just have to cost nothing, no matter how much they're worth, those aren't kinds of software they can do.

Programmers who can aren't dying out, but too few realize they're no longer the story.  Toppling barriers between coder can-do and source code can still serve progress.  But on a free Web, rallying cries for the few shouldn't hold back the many, even if they got there first.  If there's one way to software right on the Web, it needs to enable the lot, not impose trade-offs.

Big numbers win in the end.  Coders and companies are going to pay for tools and components again.  They're going to get their money's worth, and they're going to outcompete rivals who don't.  New talent both working and selling online will do for languages, databases, libraries, and frameworks what offshoring, immigration, and remote work have already done for the rest of software.  It's coming.

Facilitating this change, rather than fighting it, is a big, unrealized opportunity for those who do have skills and spare cycles.  Bigger than applying known tech to one more market niche after another, startup by startup, product by product.  The game can be changed.

At the same time, guiding this process, not just leaving it to market logic, is a big, unrealized political challenge.  Will the world software market be a free, open Web or a private platform under some feudal firms' pricey protection?  Or will activists fall flat-footed again?

None of this is hard to deduce.  It's worth considering why it's so hard to see, and so unpleasant.

## Dissonance

Coders of the '90s and 2000s brought software dist and dev online.  Open source gave them a story, jargon, heroes, allies, and enemies---a way to see the software world.  They won some recognition.  But their program left funding and payoff to industry and the academy.  They made their money in meatspace, when they needed to make money at all.

The early Web did not do payments.  It barely did access control.  Naturally, its conjoined ideology, freedom of information, made gating access or permission on payment taboo.  Gating software meant preventing copies, handling money, or both.  Either was awkward or impossible in practice.  So open source them unnecessary.

Even with PayPal, eBay, Amazon, and Transport Layer Security in the late 1990s, it took years for Americans to trust their money to the Net.  Open source, like the Web that coevolved it, moved furthest and spread fastest by leveraging what it had as it shipped.  This was the land-grab stage, for installed base and mindshare.  Feature fights came later.

We're well past that now.  Today's Internet people grow up on a more complete Web.  It does a lot more, for a whole lot more people.  Public calls to pay are as common online as in real life.

It's not just ads, like in the early days.  The very words "platform" and "marketplace" are merging.  If you make stuff on the Internet for others today, chances are good your distributor also wants to be your payment processor.  They pave a path for going pro.  They often facilitate segmenting free from premium, then "monetizing" one or both.

Then there's open source.  The paved path for open source is an off-ramp: go make money doing something, anything, else.  One rule for the Internet, and another for software.  And not even all of software.

Even software components around older industries, like games, music, or manufacturing, don't suffer this exceptionalism.  Nor, of course, do most consumer apps.  Outside open source, there's often not just a market, but competing software marketplaces, angling to bring more buyers and showcase more seller success.  The less advantaged a seller, the more appealing their story.  [Horatio Alger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Alger) again.

## GitHub

GitHub launched a software marketplace five years ago...[for GitHub integrations](https://github.blog/2017-05-22-introducing-github-marketplace-and-more-tools-to-customize-your-workflow/).  A month later, they hosted the first [Sustain](https://sustainoss.org/assets/pdf/SustainOSS-west-2017-report.pdf).  After two years, [joining the Borg](https://news.microsoft.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-to-acquire-github-for-7-5-billion/), and another Sustain, they didn't open Marketplace to the rest of software as we know it.  They [first-partied donations](https://github.blog/2019-05-23-announcing-github-sponsors-a-new-way-to-contribute-to-open-source/), then literally threw [free](https://docs.github.com/en/sponsors/getting-started-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors#about-the-github-sponsors-matching-fund) [money](https://docs.github.com/en/sponsors/getting-started-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors#about-github-sponsors) at it, to close the [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com)-[Open Collective](https://www.opencollective.com) gap.

For what GitHub does, there's a market.  For what we do on GitHub, a tip jar.

Donations, in a word, are weak.  They excel in just one way: offending almost no one.   As long as you don't beg too often.  As long as you don't beg too loud.

GitHub does donation as a button with a heart on it.  The button resides in a sidebar, often below the fold.  The button is gray.  Very weak.  Very safe.

Even with optimized appeals and big, shiny "calls to action", tips brings less than payments for good or service.  So it takes a much bigger audience to yield to make meaningful cash.  So fewer people do.  This is a problem when competing as a platform means showing off successes.

Owning distribution, GitHub can mint new celebrities.  Celebrity increases audience, which helps low-yield donations add up.  Of course, successful celebrities also promote the platform.  Careful choice of stars and starlets can bolster its image.  But there can only be so many.  If everyone's famous, even just coder-famous, then no one is.

Like the patronage platforms it cloned, GitHub Sponsors quietly morphs into a market.  The lead offering is ads, in the form of logo placements.  Largely in `README` and on Pages sites, where they [tend less to offend](https://feross.org/funding-experiment-recap/).  But wherever perks of sponsorship overlap with open expectations---access to code, availability of support, roadmap steering---they're hidden from view.  [Paid private repos.  Members-only forums.](https://github.blog/2022-02-02-new-sponsors-only-repositories-custom-amounts-and-more/)  You might use GitHub daily and not have noticed these exist.  How would you?

Microsoft paid $7.5 billion for the hub of public software distribution and development.  They want to be the payment rail of public software, too.  But money for the kind of software GitHub hosts remains stubbornly verboten.  What's a platform preaching open source to do?  [Integrate with the Microsoft Store?](https://www.pcgamer.com/microsoft-store-u-turn-open-source/)

There's no legal, technical, or business reason not to.  Just a conceptual one.  Which is to say, not much of one.

[It's already begun.](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/libreoffice/9PB80DCFP83W)  But perhaps also too late?

## Blockchain

Open source left payment offline and avoided talking money.  In hindsight, this is basically a spell to summon Blockchain.  If there's a spell to make crypto people _stop_ talking money, no one's found it yet.

The blockchain set also makes a lot of open source.  The practice all the rituals it preaches, from license unto foundation.  But they missed the greater lessons free to open showed, as a parable.  They repeated its mistakes.  Including, ironically, on money.

While GitHub was off convincing itself to [Sherlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(software)#Sherlocked_as_a_term) patronage, blockchain had an opening.  Instead of taking it, the decentralizers reenacted Free Software history, not as it was but ["as it ought to have been
"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_for_Creative_Anachronism).

## The Money Game

Open source left money to meatspace.  Blockchain brings money online.  But even the best coins do not usurp American dollars.  As in '99, so in '22, fantastic gains and dramatic losses are invariably stated in USD, for the headlines.  Nominal, highly hypothetical, dubiously redeemable gains.

Under the dot-com bubble, many open source contributors with serious suit resentment nonetheless cheered for certain startups, even for IBM.  Even some without financial stakes came to see them as surrogates or champions, securing recognition on behalf of nerd-kind.  Alas, the necessary rituals, from wrangling E-Trade to buy $RHT to signing FedEx for fancy-paper stock certificates, tended to spoil the sweet taste of victory.  They belied the narrative of success.  It was winning, but not on their terms.  Winning by concession to lawyers and bankers.  Winning offline.

Between making up money and convincing the world to take it and accepting cryptic promises from sleazy suit-bound finance types, there's an obvious, well trodden path.  Programmers delivering valuable work should be paid in the coin of their realm.  Dollars.  Euros.  Rupees.  Pesos.  Whatever they spend for food, shelter, and services.  Not unvested promises therefore.  If there are costs for transfer or exchange, the customer should bear them.

This, together with the money, is paying respect.  It is validating value.

## The Meta Game

Open source brought free software back to heel under business.  Blockchain, we're told, revived the revolution, challenging The Valley and The Street.  But blockchain success looks awfully familiar.  Whipping up frenzies and pitching investors.  Taking companies public.  Trumpeting deals with established firms.  Putting lobbyists on retainer.  Purchasing sports cars.

Startup stuff.  Bubble 2.0.

Blockchain, like open source, is "winning", but winning conventionally, not by doing what it promised, but by earning the usual fame and fortune for its lucky few.  The Fed did more "quantitative easing" during COVID, inflating also crypto, until it all came down.  Apple, [now a literal walled garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Park), remains the biggest firm on earth.

True believers hold out hope.  When some of "theirs" become rich and influential, they can beat The Man without somehow becoming him.  Coinbase, Block, and Blockchain.com will as Cobalt, Red Hat, and VA before them.  Or did they?

Blockchain devs don't get the awkwards talking money.  They get excited.  It's an improvement, on a trend asymptotically approaching realism.  But their rampant amateur incentives engineering runs up and stops at the old taboo: charging and paying for key software, after the fact.  Like the open source entrepreneurs of the last bubble, that leaves the actual coders among them only indirect models.  Make great software, but charge for something else.  This requires more capital, which limits who can play.  It favorites fame and reputation, the kind that work on spec can buy.

The innovation, we're told, is compensating devs by preallocating tokens, letting them "premine" or otherwise dealing them in early when points are still worthless and made up.  New words make this sound new, but it isn't.  It's shaped the same as "I can't afford to pay you now, but here's a million options.  You'll be rich when we all hit it big."   Or "You should totally implement my feature for Internet points now.  Someday your GitHub will land you the research gig of your dreams."  The effects are also well in line.

Blockchain being seedy, global, and speculative at the start did make an opening for some coders Greater Silicon Valley might have missed.  Like hostile takeovers in the '80s, Free Software in the '90s, and decriminalized weed in the '10s, the wealthier and better connected players at first stood aside.  They let the others moving in run the risks and prove the concepts, like Apple watches apps and AWS sees after databases.  Once proved out, they moved in, bringing to bear their existing advantages.

Their capital pays the bills of workaday programmers who otherwise couldn't afford the game.  But the arrangements under which that happens bear the funders' influence and work to their eventual gains.  Blockchain became an opportunity for more devs in more places roughly as it ceased to pose a credible systemic threat.  Radical decentralization and financial self-sovereignty, like software freedom and hacker supremacy before them, got pushed back toward the exit as the money and its manpower flowed in.

When a "revolution" gets us excited, it's big, fundamental changes, not the same old machine turning over another cycle.  But that is the effect when a movement based on principle brings new competitive energy and methods, but not enough to speed to seize the city at once, and not enough grit to succumb it by siege.  So free software, so decentralized money.

The payoff for cooptation, or simply riding it out by attrition, is all the new techniques the insurgents brought with them, plus whatever's left of their enthusiasm to be scrounged.  The cost is the foregone revolution.   That's no cost at all to those who don't care, a boon to those who were threatened.  When the inspiration can be separated from what it inspires, it will be.  When invaders weaken the walls but fail to take the castle, a new knight often rises to unseat the king for his throne.

Did decentralization enthusiasts know the Free Software story, or the story Free Software told about itself?  It's hard to believe they'd choose to repeat the former.  They did.

Reading Linus Torvalds from back at peak open source, I'm struck by just how big a gap there often was between what Linus himself had to say and what seemingly everyone else wanted to say through him.  Linus comes across as a pretty practical guy.  But Linux was having its moment.  Everybody has their big theory.  Tie Linus and Linux in, maybe you and your theory will be important, popular, and revolutionary, too.

Not to be outdone, Linus hocked a theory of his own:

> Linus's law says that all of our motivations fall into three basic categories.  More important, progress is about going through those very same things as "phases" in a process of evolution, a matter of passing from one category to the next.  The categories, in order, are "survival," "social life," and "entertainment."

Wait a minute, you might think.  That's not Linus's Law!  [Linus's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law) is "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow".  That was actually [Eric Raymond](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html) in  _The Cathedral and the Bazaar_.  There were competing Linus's Laws.  Apparently Linus's lost.

[_Just For Fun_](https://www.harperbusiness.com/book/9780066620732/Just-for-Fun-Linus-Torvalds-and-David-Diamond/), which also mentions Linus's Linu's Law, is the book to read.   But _The Hacker Ethic_'s the one to preserve for science, as the probable epitome of [Dot-Com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble)-era theory hitching.  Only the prologue's by Linus, standing in for [Levy-ite hackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution), rather than "free software" or "open source" as such.  The epilogue's yet another tie-in, for a newly revised, 1,500-page academic trilogy assumingly titled [_The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Information_Age:_Economy,_Society_and_Culture).  Running the middle is a 153-page mini-monograph by a fellow-Finnish philosopher, arguing that generalized hackerdom's relationship to work represents a new, paradigm-busting---and thoroughly hacker-flattering---departure from the [Protestant work ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_work_ethic), beyond both capitalism and communism.  The author's conclusion features mock corporate board meeting minutes for creation of the universe and a written contract for God's grace in two installments, disputes resolved in Helsinki.  I shit you not.

Linus's bit does boast some choice bits of Torvaldsian bluntness, characteristically lost in the hype.  One in particular stands out to me now: Hacking is for rich people.  The money problem isn't just assumed away.  Its absence largely defines the phenomenon.

In Linus' words:

> To hackers, survival is not the main thing.  They'll survive quite well on Twinkies and Jolt Cola.  Seriously, by the time you have a computer on your desk, it's not likely that your first worry is how to get the next meal or keep a roof over your head.  Survival is still there as a motivational factor, but it's not really an everyday concern to the exclusion of other motivations anymore.

And most succinctly:

> A "hacker" is a person who has gone past using his computer for survival ("I bring home the bread by programming") to the next two stages.

A hacker is rich or from a rich, generous country.  Their basic material requirements are currently and prospectively met.  That leaves "social life" and "entertainment".  Cred, clout, intrinsic interest, personal fulfillment.  All those finer things up toward the pointy end of [Maslow's pyramid](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:MaslowHierarchy.png&oldid=707155329).  Which is pretty clear prior art for Linus's Law.

Hacking is not the same as open source.  Workaday people occasionally do get jobs slinging open code, and are often disappointed how much like the rest of work it is.  But the story's that the better software, the real revolutionary stuff, expresses frenetic hacker self-actualization, not some corporate budget item.  If corporations happen to be involved, it's odd lapses in authoritarianism, when they hire good people, put them in a lab, allow them to release, and forget about them.

"You must be this rich to do proper hacking" is not something bread-needing coders recently tapped into the decades-long pep rally for "community-driven" open source want to hear.  The instinct is to quibble, especially given changes since 2001.  Many people very much caught up in making rent and feeding children also have computers these days.

But there are blunt truths here.  People on effective sabbatical often turn out work of a different kind from from business product as usual.  And having created genuinely competitive software---on function or on price---it takes a certain level of financial indifference, or the ignorance born of a life so far exempt from business education, to give it away gratis.  At the organizational level, it's a mark of structural power to [dump on the market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumping_(pricing_policy)), confident in ability to profit from the distortion.

If we accept these constraints as frankly as Linus put them, even as loose heuristics, some clear implications for the big picture follow.  Moreso than "sustainability", software should concern itself with opportunity.  The optimum isn't openness, or even zero price, as such.  The optimum is whatever builds up the most potentially talented programmers, pushing them past subsistence with time and energy left to progress the field.

We shouldn't stop at stores whose success will put us out of work.  As programmers, we shouldn't push policy or culture that narrows who can be a hacker.  If we pretend the only interests worth optimizing are the ones we have as users, we end up with a very thin, narrow class of who can survive as producers.  Programming stays stuck in old ways, and whole categories of needs go unmet, because the kinds of people who can make livings making software can't see or feel them.

Reading Linus Torvalds from back at peak open source, I'm struck by how big the gap could be between what Linus had to say for himself and what seemingly everyone else wanted to say through him.  Linus comes across a pretty practical guy, but Linux was having its moment.  Everybody has their big idea.  Tie Linus in, maybe you and your theory will be important, popular, and timely, too.

Not to be outdone, Linus hocked his own social insight:

> Linus's law says that all of our motivations fall into three basic categories.  More important, progress is about going through those very same things as "phases" in a process of evolution, a matter of passing from one category to the next.  The categories, in order, are "survival," "social life," and "entertainment."

Wait a minute, you might think.  That's not Linus's Law!  [Linus's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law) is "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow".  But that was actually [Eric S. Raymond](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html) in  _The Cathedral and the Bazaar_, who stuck Linus' name on it.  There were competing Linus's Laws.  Apparently Linus's lost.

[_Just For Fun_](https://www.harperbusiness.com/book/9780066620732/Just-for-Fun-Linus-Torvalds-and-David-Diamond/), which also mentions Linus's Law---Linus's version---is the book to read for Linux's origin story.   But _The Hacker Ethic_ is the one to preserve for science, as the probable epitome of [Dot-Com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble)-era theory hitching.  Only the prologue's by Linus, standing in for [Levy-ite hackerdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution) at large.  The epilogue's yet another tie-in, for a newly revised, 1,500-page academic trilogy assumingly titled [_The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Information_Age:_Economy,_Society_and_Culture).  In between runs a 153-page mini-monograph by a fellow-Finn philosopher, arguing that generalized hackerdom's relationship to work represents a new, paradigm-busting---and thoroughly hacker-flattering---break from the [Protestant Work Ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_work_ethic) at the core of European civilization.  The author's conclusion features mock corporate board minutes for creation of the universe and a draft contract for God's grace in two installments, disputes resolved in Helsinki.  I shit you not.

Linus's bit does boast some choice bits of Torvaldsian bluntness, characteristically lost in the hype.  One in particular stands out to me now:  Hacking is for rich people.

The money problem isn't just assumed away.  Its absence in part defines the status of hacker.  In Linus' words:

> To hackers, survival is not the main thing.  They'll survive quite well on Twinkies and Jolt Cola.  Seriously, by the time you have a computer on your desk, it's not likely that your first worry is how to get the next meal or keep a roof over your head.  Survival is still there as a motivational factor, but it's not really an everyday concern to the exclusion of other motivations anymore.

And most succinctly:

> A "hacker" is a person who has gone past using his computer for survival ("I bring home the bread by programming") to the next two stages.

A hacker is rich or from a rich, generous country.  Their basic material requirements are currently and prospectively met.  That leaves "social life" and "entertainment" and a computer with which to try and get them.  Cred.  Clout. Intrinsic fulfillment.  Personal expression.  All those finer things up toward the pointy end of [Maslow's pyramid](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:MaslowHierarchy.png&oldid=707155329).  Which is pretty clear prior art for Linus's Law.

In a strict sense, hacking is not the same as open source.  Workaday people occasionally do get jobs slinging code, even fairly boring code, online.  But those new to the game are often disappointed by just how much like the rest of work it can be.  The story we like to hear and tell is that the better stuff, the real revolutionary software, comes out on open terms and expresses self-actualized hacker frenzy, not some corporate budget allocation.  If businesses happen to be involved, it's only by odd lapses in their native authoritarianism.  Occasionally they're known to hire good people, group them in a "lab", allow them to release their work, and benignly neglect to manage them.

"You must be this rich to do proper hacking" is not something bread-needing coders recently tapped into the decades-running pep rally for "community" open source want to hear.  The instinctive response is to quibble, stressing new changes since 2001.  Many people very much caught up in making rent, buying food, and supporting family have computers these days.  Networked compute has been "democratized", in the narrow sense that more people have it.

But there are blunt truths in Linus' amateur philosophy.  People on effective sabbatical do seem more capable of turning out work of a different kind from business as usual.  And having created some genuinely competitive bit of code---competitive on function, competitive on price---it takes a certain level of financial indifference, or the ignorance of one who's never had to think business, to give it all away unconditionally.  Scaled up to the organizational level, it's a mark of structural power to [dump valuable goods on the market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumping_(pricing_policy)), confident in structural position to profit disproportionately from resulting distortions.

If we accept these dynamics as frankly as Linus put them, even just as loose heuristics, some clear implications for the big picture follow.  Moreso than "sustainability", those concerned with progress in software ought to think about opportunity.  Progress isn't just a slow march toward 100% of interesting code for $0 on permissive terms.  Optimization is an ongoing tuning problem, both marshaling as much talent as the market can bear and pushing as many talented programmers past the point of subsistence as possible, with time and energy left to advance the art.  Not all worker drones.  Not all hacker gentlemen of leisure.  Both, and a continuous line of potential models in between.

It's generally unwise to shop at stores whose success might put you out of work, even if it costs slightly less this week.  As programmers, we shouldn't push absolutes, in policy or in culture, that narrow down who can make money how, or choose not to.  If we pretend the only interests worth optimizing for are the ones we have as users, rather than creators or maintainers, we end up with a very thin, peculiar class of people who can make it in software production.  Lower capacity keeps programming stuck in old ways.  Whole categories of needs go unmet, because the kinds of people who can make a living making software don't see or feel those problems.  This seems an awful lot like where we are now.

As I've been ticking off my Linus reading list, I've also been catching up on writing from [Raymond Nimmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Nimmer), an intellectual property law professor and early law blogger who died in 2018.  I haven't always agreed with his positions, but I've come to better respect his point of view.  Fundamentally, Raymond came at legal policy questions as a steward.  He wanted a system that could "work" not just for one diametrically opposed interest group or another, but for all their business models, plus any number in between.

[Blogging on copy protection back in 2009](https://web.archive.org/web/20090901061357/http://www.ipinfoblog.com:80/archives/intellectual-property-content-protection-and-copyright.html), he wrote:

> While valuable works are produced by individuals not seeking to commercialize their work, other important information projects only occur where substantial financial support or commercial benefits exist or can be realistically sought.  <mark>Intellectual property law must support both and the range of options in between, but it is too often easy to ignore one of these models in policy discussions.</mark>

All software should be free software.  All software costs to make, and makers should be paid their works' full worth.

> Some of the economic stress of the content industries is attributable to the <mark>inevitable adjustments caused by new technology and social expectations</mark>.  Thus, a business model that assumes that a content producer or publisher can charge high prices for copies faces the likelihood of greater seepage (piracy) in a digital world than in a plastic world.  But while many in the public are comfortable copying commercial content created by others, most do not do so without authorization.  <mark>One role of law and its enforcement, of course, is to shape and influence expectations about complying with the norms set out in law.</mark>

As someone who studied policy debates of the past, participated in debates of the present, and anticipated debates still to come, Nimmer embraced the importance not just of law's internal working, buts its broader social function, in context.  His mental model of people wasn't just as property owners or pirates, but as independent actors trying to make a go, outside the gears of the law most of the time.  But not entirely free of its influence.

People try new business models all the time.  They rediscover why some old ones got discarded.  In the large, this is a form of testing constraints.  Those constraints, which may be technical or legal, shift over time and must be probed.  Highly general laws like copyright didn't so much fix a state of play in statute, then try to control it, as coexist and coevolve as one of my factors.  As a repository of old compromises, the law's natural role is often that  of middle ground in times of rapid change elsewhere:

> We are where we are today in terms of intellectual property policy and its impact on the content industries in part because of an on-going conflict between groups that, respectively, seek enhancement or protection of property rights, and those who would prefer a diminishing role for intellectual property (especially for copyright) in digital environments.  One theme frequently cited by the latter group argues that <mark>"information wants to be free" and that to the extent that commercial incentives or profit online are desired, they should be sought in ancillary ways, such as through advertising revenue</mark>, while the information itself is made freely available. ...

In Raymond's terms, today's coders are also content creators.  Good stewardship of copyright means supporting a gamut of economic models for them, too.  Be they financially liberated hobbyists, workaday clock punchers, independent entrepreneurs, or anything in between.

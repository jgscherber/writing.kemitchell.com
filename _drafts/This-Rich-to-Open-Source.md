Reading Linus Torvalds from back at peak open source, I'm struck by just how big a gap there often was between what Linus had to say and what everyone else suddenly wanted to say through him, about him, with him, or anyway vaguely connected to him.  Linus seems like a practical guy.  But Linux was having its moment.  Everybody's got their big theory.  Tie Linus and Linux into your theory, maybe you and yours will be important, popular, and revolutionary, too.  Typical thought leader jockeying.

Not to be totally outdone, Linus had a theory of his own:

> Linus's law says that all of our motivations fall into three basic categories.  More important, progress is about going through those very same things as "phases" in a process of evolution, a matter of passing from one category to the next.  The categories, in order, are "survival," "social life," and "entertainment."

Wait a minute.  That's not Linus's Law!  [Linus's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law) is "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow".  The one [coined by Eric Raymond](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html) in  _The Cathedral and the Bazaar_, which came out in 1999.  But you can also find the Linus's Law quoted above at beginning and end of Linus's team-written, kind-of autobiography, [_Just For Fun_](https://www.harperbusiness.com/book/9780066620732/Just-for-Fun-Linus-Torvalds-and-David-Diamond/), also out two years later, in 2001.  There were competing Linus's Laws.  Apparently Linus's lost.

_Just For Fun_ is the one to read about early Linux, but _The Hacker Ethic_ is the one to keep for science, as the probable epitome of [bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble)-era theory hitching.  The prologue is by Linus.  The epilogue's a tie-in from an [academic sociologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Castells) fresh off a rewrite of a 1,500-page trilogy assumingly titled [_The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Information_Age:_Economy,_Society_and_Culture).  In between, it's a 153-page mini-monograph by a fellow-Finn philosopher, arguing that generalized hackerdom's relationship to work represents a new, paradigm-busting---and thoroughly hacker-flattering---break from Weber's [Protestant work ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_work_ethic), askance of capitalism and communism alike.  The author's conclusion features mock corporate board meeting minutes for creation of the universe and a written contract for God's grace in two installments, disputes to be resolved in Helsinki.  I shit you not.

Leading into all that, Linus's intro does bring some bits of choice Torvaldsian bluntness.  They are easy to miss now, given the context.  They were easy to overshadow back then, given the competition.  But one thought in particular sticks out to my eye.

Hacking is for rich people.

In Linus' words:

> To hackers, survival is not the main thing.  They'll survive quite well on Twinkies and Jolt Cola.  Seriously, by the time you have a computer on your desk, it's not likely that your first worry is how to get the next meal or keep a roof over your head.  Survival is still there as a motivational factor, but it's not really an everyday concern to the exclusion of other motivations anymore.

And most succinctly:

> A "hacker" is a person who has gone past using his computer for survival ("I bring home the bread by programming") to the next two stages.

A hacker is rich or from a rich, generous country.  Like Finland.  Their basic material requirements are currently and prospectively met.  That leaves "social life" and "entertainment".  Cred, clout, intrinsic interest, personal fulfillment.  All those finer things up toward the pointy end of [Maslow's pyramid of needs](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:MaslowHierarchy.png&oldid=707155329).  Which is pretty clear prior art for Linus's Law.

Hacking is not the same as open source.  Workaday people can and do get jobs slinging open code, and are often disappointed how much it is like the rest of work.  But the implication is of course that the better stuff, the revolutionary stuff, expresses frenetic hacker actualization, not some line-item on a corporate budget.  Some of us like to say that open source created the Internet.  But there was competition for that claim back in the day in the phenom of hacking.

"You must be this rich to do proper open source" is not something bread-needing coders who've recently tapped into the continuous, decades-long pep rally for open source want to read.  And it is easy to quibble with the proposition, especially given changes since 2001.  Many people very much caught up in making rent and feeding children also have computers these days.

But there are basic truths here.  People essentially on social sabbatical do and have done different work from what business as usual tends to emit.  Having created genuinely competitive software---on function or on price---it's an expression of wealth, or of foolishness, to give it away gratis.  It's an statement of confidence in structural power to [dump it on the market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumping_(pricing_policy)), in order to profit from the distortion.

If we accept these constraints as frankly as Linus put them, even just as heuristics, and not as absolutes, some clear implications for the big picture follow.  Moreso than "sustainability", the concern for progress in software is opportunity.  For some---thanks to cheapening compute and networking, most---the optimum isn't openness.  The optimum is what it takes to progress them past subsistence.  Our legal rules, collective "adoption" practices, and social norms need to pave a path that more people who aren't born in Finland or other wealthy parts of the industrialized world can walk toward freedom to express their full potential.

Reading Linus Torvalds from back at peak open source, I'm struck by just how big a gap there often was between what Linus wanted to say and what everyone else suddenly wanted to say with him, through him, about him, or anyway vaguely connected to him.  Everybody's got their big theory.  Linux was new, important, and inspiring.  Tie Linux into your big theory, maybe you and yours will be important, popular, and inspiring, too.  Typical thought leader jockeying.

Not to be left out, however, Linus had a theory of his own:

> Linus's law says that all of our motivations fall into three basic categories.  More important, progress is about going through those very same things as "phases" in a process of evolution, a matter of passing from one category to the next.  The categories, in order, are "survival," "social life," and "entertainment."

But wait a minute.  That's not Linus's Law!  [Linus's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law) is "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow".  The one [coined by Eric Raymond](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html), who named it for Linus in  _The Cathedral and the Bazaar_, out in print in 1999.  But you can find the same "Linus's Law" quoted above at beginning and end of his team-written, kind-of-auto biography, [_Just For Fun_](https://www.harperbusiness.com/book/9780066620732/Just-for-Fun-Linus-Torvalds-and-David-Diamond/), also out two years later, in 2001.  There were competing "Linus's Laws".  Apparently Linus's lost.

_Just For Fun_, Amazon rank #162,827 today, is the book to buy about Linus and early theory hitching.  But _The Hacker Ethic_, Amazon rank #2,770,210, is the one to keep for science as the probable epitome of [bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble)-era Linus chasing.  It's a 153-page fellow-Finn philosopher's mini-monograph---with ample type and generous line spacing---book-ended by a prologue from Linus and an epilogue by an [academic sociologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Castells) fresh off a rewrite of his 1,500-page academic trilogy assumingly titled [_The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Information_Age:_Economy,_Society_and_Culture).  The big idea in the meat of the book is that computer hackers' relationship to work represents a new, paradigm-busting---and hacker-flattering---break from Weber's [Protestant work ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_work_ethic).  The conclusion features mock corporate board meeting minutes for creation of the universe and a written contract for God's grace in two installments, disputes to be resolved in Helsinki.  I shit you not.

Trying now to forget all that, Linus's prologue does bring some bits of choice Torvaldsian bluntness.  They are easy to miss now, given the context, and were easy to overshadow back then, given the competition.  One in particular catches my eye now.

Hacking is for rich people.  Sustainability is not a problem.

In Linus' words:

> To hackers, survival is not the main thing.  They'll survive quite well on Twinkies and Jolt Cola.  Seriously, by the time you have a computer on your desk, it's not likely that your first worry is how to get the next meal or keep a roof over your head.  Survival is still there as a motivational factor, but it's not really an everyday concern to the exclusion of other motivations anymore.

And most succinctly:

> A "hacker" is a person who has gone past using his computer for survival ("I bring home the bread by programming") to the next two stages.

A hacker is rich, or lives in a rich, generous country.  Your basic material requirements are currently and prospectively met.  The next two stages are "social life" and "entertainment".  Cred, clout, intrinsic personal fulfillment.  All those finer things up toward the pointy end of [Maslow's pyramid of needs](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:MaslowHierarchy.png&oldid=707155329).

What hackers do is not the same as open source.

Reading Linus Torvalds from back at peak open source, I'm struck again by just how big a gap there often was between what Linus Torvalds wanted to say to the world and what everyone else wanted to say through him, about him, around him, or vaguely associated with him in any not totally incredible way.  Everyone has their big theory.  Linux was important, popular, and inspiring.  Fit Linux into your their theory, maybe you and your theory would be important, popular, and inspiring, too.

Being human, Linus also had a theory:

> Linus's law says that all of our motivations fall into three basic categories.  More important, progress is about going through those very same things as "phases" in a process of evolution, a matter of passing from one category to the next.  The categories, in order, are "survival," "social life," and "entertainment."

You can find the same "Linus's Law" at the beginning and end of his team-written, demi-auto biography, _Just For Fun_, out the same year.

But wait a minute, you think.  That's not Linus's Law!  [Linus's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law) is "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow".  The one [coined by Raymond](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html), who named it for Linus in  _The Cathedral and the Bazaar_.  That one came out in print in 1999.  _The Hacker Ethic_, quoted above, came out in 2001.  It's hard to know what was written when.  There were blog posts and interview and lead times ahead of all of this.  Anyway, it was heady days.

_Just For Fun_, Amazon rank #162,827 today, is the obvious book to buy about Linus.  But _The Hacker Ethic_, Amazon rank #2,770,210, is another one to keep in glass for science, the probable epitome of [bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble)-era theory hitching.  It's a 153-page Finnish philosopher's mini-monograph---with ample type and generous line spacing---book-ended by a prologue from Linus and an epilogue by an [academic sociologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Castells) just off a major revision of his 1,500-page, theoretically expansive trilogy titled, assumingly, [_The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Information_Age:_Economy,_Society_and_Culture).

The Finnish philosopher's thrust is that computer hackers' relationship to work offers a new, paradigm-busting break from Weber's [Protestant work ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_work_ethic).  His conclusion features mock corporate board meeting minutes for creation of the universe and a written contract for God's grace in two installments, with noncompete, disputes resolved by litigation in Helsinki.  I shit you not.

Amid all this attempted coattail riding, there are treasures of choice Torvaldsian bluntness.  Treasures that feel well buried in all this grasping, self-promotional morass.

The most important seeming, now?  Hacking is for rich people.

In his words:

> To hackers, survival is not the main thing.  They'll survive quite well on Twinkies and Jolt Cola.  Seriously, by the time you have a computer on your desk, it's not likely that your first worry is how to get the next meal or keep a roof over your head.  Survival is still there as a motivational factor, but it's not really an everyday concern to the exclusion of other motivations anymore.

And most succinctly:

> A "hacker" is a person who has gone past using his computer for survival ("I bring home the bread by programming") to the next two stages.

The next two stages, recall, are "social life" and "entertainment".  Cred, clout, intrinsic personal fulfillment.  All those finer things up toward the pointy bit of [Maslow's pyramid of needs](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:MaslowHierarchy.png&oldid=707155329).

Hacking is not the same as open source.  Himanen wants hackerism---which he naturally defines as broadly as possible---because he can attribute more to it.  When blowing up a big, expansive theory, draw broadly.

Reading Linus Torvalds from back at peak open source, I'm struck by just how big a gap there often was between what Linus wanted to say and what everyone else suddenly wanted to say through him, about him, with him, or anyway vaguely connected to him.  Everybody's got their big theory.  Linux was having its moment.  Tie Linux into your big theory, maybe you and yours will be deemed important, popular, and inspiring, too.  Typical thought leader jockeying.

Not to be left out, however, Linus had a theory of his own:

> Linus's law says that all of our motivations fall into three basic categories.  More important, progress is about going through those very same things as "phases" in a process of evolution, a matter of passing from one category to the next.  The categories, in order, are "survival," "social life," and "entertainment."

But wait a minute.  That's not Linus's Law!  [Linus's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law) is "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow".  The one [coined by Eric Raymond](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html), who named it for Linus in  _The Cathedral and the Bazaar_, out in print in 1999.  But you can find the same "Linus's Law" quoted above at beginning and end of his team-written, kind-of-auto biography, [_Just For Fun_](https://www.harperbusiness.com/book/9780066620732/Just-for-Fun-Linus-Torvalds-and-David-Diamond/), also out two years later, in 2001.  There were competing "Linus's Laws".  Apparently Linus's lost.

_The Hacker Ethic_ is one to keep for social science as the probable epitome of [bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble)-era Linus chasing.  It's a 153-page mini-monograph by a fellow-Finn philosopher.  The prologue is by Linus.  The epilogue's from an [academic sociologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Castells) fresh off a rewrite of a 1,500-page trilogy assumingly titled [_The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Information_Age:_Economy,_Society_and_Culture).  The meat of the book is that computer hackers' relationship to work represents a new, paradigm-busting---and hacker-flattering---break from Weber's [Protestant work ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_work_ethic).  The conclusion features mock corporate board meeting minutes for creation of the universe and a written contract for God's grace in two installments, disputes to be resolved in Helsinki.  I shit you not.

Buried in all that, Linus's prologue does bring some choice bits of choice Torvaldsian bluntness.  They are easy to miss now, given the context, and they were easy to overshadow back then, given the competition.  One in particular catches my eye now.

Hacking is for rich people.

In Linus' words:

> To hackers, survival is not the main thing.  They'll survive quite well on Twinkies and Jolt Cola.  Seriously, by the time you have a computer on your desk, it's not likely that your first worry is how to get the next meal or keep a roof over your head.  Survival is still there as a motivational factor, but it's not really an everyday concern to the exclusion of other motivations anymore.

And most succinctly:

> A "hacker" is a person who has gone past using his computer for survival ("I bring home the bread by programming") to the next two stages.

A hacker is rich or from a rich, generous country.  Their basic material requirements are currently and prospectively met.  That leaves "social life" and "entertainment".  Cred, clout, intrinsic interest, personal fulfillment.  All those finer things up toward the pointy end of [Maslow's pyramid of needs](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:MaslowHierarchy.png&oldid=707155329).

Hacking is not the same as open source.  People can and do get paid to code open source, in sometimes disappointingly workaday ways.  But the implication is of course that the better stuff, the revolutionary stuff, expresses hacker frenzy, rather than some company's budget allocation.

"You must be this rich to do proper open source" is not something coders who've basically attended a thirty year continuous online open source pep rally want to hear.  And it is easy to quibble with the theory, especially given changes since 2001.  Many people very much caught up in bringing home the bread also have computers these days.

Reading Linus Torvalds from the peak of open source's hype cycle, you get a sense for just how big a gap there could be between what he had to say and what other people wanted to say about him.  What actual Linus had to say was a lot more frank, concrete, and practical.  Everybody had big-picture theories they wanted to hitch onto Linux.  Linus did some of his own musing, but was mostly actually making Linux work.

Case in point, Linus' Law:

> Linus's law says that all of our motivations fall into three basic categories.  More important, progress is about going through those very same things as "phases" in a process of evolution, a matter of passing from one category to the next.  The categories, in order, are "survival," "social life," and "entertainment."

Wait a minute, you think.  That's not Linus's Law!  [Linus's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law) is "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow".  That was [coined by Eric S. Raymond and _named_ for Linus Torvalds](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html).  _The Cathedral and the Bazaar_ came out in 1999.  _The Hacker Ethic_, quoted above, came out in 2001.  Heady days.

_The Hacker Ethic_ is a perfect example of big theory trying to extrapolate itself from open source.  This is easier to see because, as far as I know, Himanen's book never really got traction, and because his big theory has very little to do with software. It's a 153-page monograph, with ample type and generous line spacing, book-ended by Linus' prologue and an epilogue by an [academic sociologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Castells) behind a then recently revised, 1,500-page academic trilogy expansively titled [_The Information Age_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Information_Age:_Economy,_Society_and_Culture).  Himanen's main thrust is that computer hackers' relationship to work offers a new, paradigm-busting break from Weber's [Protestant work ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_work_ethic).  As we say, I shit you not.

> To hackers, survival is not the main thing.  They'll survive quite well on Twinkies and Jolt Cola.  Seriously, by the time you have a computer on your desk, it's not likely that your first worry is how to get the next meal or keep a roof over your head.  Survival is still there as a motivational factor, but it's not really an everyday concern to the exclusion of other motivations anymore.

> A "hacker" is a person who has gone past using his computer for survival ("I bring home the bread by programming") to the next two stages.

Open source left payment offline and avoided talking money.  In hindsight, this is basically a spell to summon Blockchain.  If there's a spell to make crypto people _stop_ talking money, no one's found it yet.

The blockchain set also makes a lot of open source.  The practice all the rituals it preaches, from license unto foundation.  But they missed the greater lessons free to open showed, as a parable.  They repeated its mistakes.  Including, ironically, on money.

While GitHub was off convincing itself to [Sherlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(software)#Sherlocked_as_a_term) patronage, blockchain had an opening.  Instead of taking it, the decentralizers reenacted Free Software history, not as it was but ["as it ought to have been
"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_for_Creative_Anachronism).

## The Money Game

Open source left money to meatspace.  Blockchain brings money online.  But even the best coins do not usurp American dollars.  As in '99, so in '22, fantastic gains and dramatic losses are invariably stated in USD, for the headlines.  Nominal, highly hypothetical, dubiously redeemable gains.

Under the dot-com bubble, many open source contributors with serious suit resentment nonetheless cheered for certain startups, even for IBM.  Even some without financial stakes came to see them as surrogates or champions, securing recognition on behalf of nerd-kind.  Alas, the necessary rituals, from wrangling E-Trade to buy $RHT to signing FedEx for fancy-paper stock certificates, tended to spoil the sweet taste of victory.  They belied the narrative of success.  It was winning, but not on their terms.  Winning by concession to lawyers and bankers.  Winning offline.

Between making up money and convincing the world to take it and accepting cryptic promises from sleazy suit-bound finance types, there's an obvious, well trodden path.  Programmers delivering valuable work should be paid in the coin of their realm.  Dollars.  Euros.  Rupees.  Pesos.  Whatever they spend for food, shelter, and services.  Not unvested promises therefore.  If there are costs for transfer or exchange, the customer should bear them.

This, together with the money, is paying respect.  It is validating value.

## The Meta Game

Open source brought free software back to heel under business.  Blockchain, we're told, revived the revolution, challenging The Valley and The Street.  But blockchain success looks awfully familiar.  Whipping up frenzies and pitching investors.  Taking companies public.  Trumpeting deals with established firms.  Putting lobbyists on retainer.  Purchasing sports cars.

Startup stuff.  Bubble 2.0.

Blockchain, like open source, is "winning", but winning conventionally, not by doing what it promised, but by earning the usual fame and fortune for its lucky few.  The Fed did more "quantitative easing" during COVID, inflating also crypto, until it all came down.  Apple, [now a literal walled garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Park), remains the biggest firm on earth.

True believers hold out hope.  When some of "theirs" become rich and influential, they can beat The Man without somehow becoming him.  Coinbase, Block, and Blockchain.com will as Cobalt, Red Hat, and VA before them.  Or did they?

Blockchain devs don't get the awkwards talking money.  They get excited.  It's an improvement, on a trend asymptotically approaching realism.  But their rampant amateur incentives engineering runs up and stops at the old taboo: charging and paying for key software, after the fact.  Like the open source entrepreneurs of the last bubble, that leaves the actual coders among them only indirect models.  Make great software, but charge for something else.  This requires more capital, which limits who can play.  It favorites fame and reputation, the kind that work on spec can buy.

The innovation, we're told, is compensating devs by preallocating tokens, letting them "premine" or otherwise dealing them in early when points are still worthless and made up.  New words make this sound new, but it isn't.  It's shaped the same as "I can't afford to pay you now, but here's a million options.  You'll be rich when we all hit it big."   Or "You should totally implement my feature for Internet points now.  Someday your GitHub will land you the research gig of your dreams."  The effects are also well in line.

Blockchain being seedy, global, and speculative at the start did make an opening for some coders Greater Silicon Valley might have missed.  Like hostile takeovers in the '80s, Free Software in the '90s, and decriminalized weed in the '10s, the wealthier and better connected players at first stood aside.  They let the others moving in run the risks and prove the concepts, like Apple watches apps and AWS sees after databases.  Once proved out, they moved in, bringing to bear their existing advantages.

Their capital pays the bills of workaday programmers who otherwise couldn't afford the game.  But the arrangements under which that happens bear the funders' influence and work to their eventual gains.  Blockchain became an opportunity for more devs in more places roughly as it ceased to pose a credible systemic threat.  Radical decentralization and financial self-sovereignty, like software freedom and hacker supremacy before them, got pushed back toward the exit as the money and its manpower flowed in.

When a "revolution" gets us excited, it's big, fundamental changes, not the same old machine turning over another cycle.  But that is the effect when a movement based on principle brings new competitive energy and methods, but not enough to speed to seize the city at once, and not enough grit to succumb it by siege.  So free software, so decentralized money.

The payoff for cooptation, or simply riding it out by attrition, is all the new techniques the insurgents brought with them, plus whatever's left of their enthusiasm to be scrounged.  The cost is the foregone revolution.   That's no cost at all to those who don't care, a boon to those who were threatened.  When the inspiration can be separated from what it inspires, it will be.  When invaders weaken the walls but fail to take the castle, a new knight often rises to unseat the king for his throne.

Did decentralization enthusiasts know the Free Software story, or the story Free Software told about itself?  It's hard to believe they'd choose to repeat the former.  They did.

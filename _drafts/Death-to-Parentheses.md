title: Death to Parentheses
---

A few months into COVID, on a call with my father, I had one of those moments when you talk and heard yourself talking at the same time.  I realized I was reasoning, maybe arguing, with words and phrases I'd heard, at most, a few months ago, during the pandemic.  I started listing these terms---basic reproduction number, case fatality rate, community spread, herd immunity, and so on---but gave up.  There were a lot.

February 24, 2022, the start of Russia's second invasion of Ukraine, was more than seven months ago.  Since February 24, I've had my brain soaked in yet another word soup: the jargon of military analysts.  Military analysts say and write things like:

> Force planners balance the "Iron Triangle" of capability (more and better equipment), capacity (more forces), and readiness (more prepared to go to war) within the budget.

Many of these military analysts write with a new expectation that more people like me, who aren't military analysts, will read them.  They become self-conscious of their jargon.  Which leads to a lot of parentheses.

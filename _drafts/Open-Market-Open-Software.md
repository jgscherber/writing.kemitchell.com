The open source mindset in 2022 is right where proprietary mania was thirty years ago: standing in the way of the biggest rush of pent-up programmer potential yet to hit computing.  Half of humanity's online.  Millions more could contribute fundamental software.  But they'll need to earn in the open, not just work there.  They'll need an open users pay for.

When old believers say money and open source shouldn't mix, what more and more prospects hear is that they're not welcome.  They know there's money all over open source.  But they can't work for nothing, wait years to catch a break, or raise seed money or a grant to pay their bills.  If coding in the open can't pay as they go, they can't code in the open.  If some kinds of software just have to cost nothing, no matter how much they're worth, those aren't kinds of software they can do.

Programmers who can aren't dying out, but they're no longer the story.  Potential workaday coders outnumber hackers of leisure today like hackers outnumber staffs at proprietary software firms.  Toppling barriers between coder can-do and source code enables technical progression, be they legal, technical, or financial.  Problems begin when the slogans and heuristics for a few, concerned with a narrow class of problems, harden into barriers of their own for those coming after.  If there's one ideal for getting software made online, it needs to maximize contribution Web-wide, not enshrine a local maximum and impose conflicts from there.

Big numbers win in the end.  Coders and companies are going to pay for basic tools and components again, they're going to get their money's worth, and they're going to outcompete those who don't.  Because licensing's the next rung up the business-model ladder that workaday coders can reach from entry-level global jobs.  Not just collaborating on the open Web, but finding and selling to customers there.  Not by monetizing something else, requiring money or time they don't have, but by monetizing what they do.

Newly unblocked talent will do for languages, databases, libraries, and frameworks what offshoring, immigration, and remote work have already done for the rest of software built with them.  The potential energy of so many minds just can't be dammed up indefinitely.

Facilitating the change, rather than fighting it, is a big, unrealized opportunity for those who do have skills and spare cycles in software.  Bigger than applying known tech to one more market niche after another, startup by startup, product by product.  The software game can be improved, not just played well.

At the same time, proactively guiding this process toward open competition, rather than leaving it to the bounty hunters of Big Tech, is a big, unappreciated political challenge.  Will the world software market be a free, open Web or a private platform under some feudal firms' pricey protection?

We are engineering the answer to that question now.  We are doing it mostly socially.  We are doing it mostly without noticing.

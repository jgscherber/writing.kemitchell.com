brief: Russia reminds us that "democratizing" software as open source means giving it to autocratic governments.

In dictionaries "democratization" means more democracy, first and foremost.  In marketing it means something else.  "Democratizing robotics" means more robotics for more people, not more democracy.  "Democratizing Ecuador" means more democracy for Ecuadorians, not more Ecuador.

The very word "democracy" evokes shiny, high-minded ideals for many people.  Stretching "democratize" to also mean "make more available" helps advertisers and activists bounce that light on whatever they're pitching.  This seems to work even if there's no solid line from what they sell contributes to public institutions, civil society, fundamental principles, or any other components parts of government by and for the people.

Words change in sound and meaning.  That's what they do.  "Democracy" might be a particularly precious word.  But what's the harm in companies saying "make more available" and "we're team democracy" all at once, with one word?  Nothing.  Until what they actually do picks a fight with the ideal they're keen to name-drop.

In good times, when happy associations come to mind first, this mostly means avoiding obvious faceplants.  You won't find "democratizing surveillance" on [DJI's website](https://dji.com).  You'll find it in [book](https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/4851/chapter/563111/Democratizing-Surveillance-Drones-Satellites-and) [titles](https://thegooddrone.mitpress.mit.edu/) scaring us about drones.  You won't see [Signal](https://www.signal.org/) or [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) "[democratizing](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/13/feds-say-they-used-encrypted-messages-to-charge-oath-keepers-leader.html) [conspiracy](https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/29/politics/patriots-45-maga-gang-fanone-capitol-riot/index.html)".  You'll see them democratizing "privacy" or "security", that kind of thing.

Whether Russia has or hasn't actually [used](https://saisreview.sais.jhu.edu/russia-ai-human-rights-violations-ukraine-syria/) [specific](https://saisreview.sais.jhu.edu/russia-ai-human-rights-violations-ukraine-syria/) [devices](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russia-probably-has-not-used-ai-enabled-weapons-ukraine-could-change) equipped with recent machine learning tech, it's safe to say their coders---those who haven't already fled country or quit state jobs---remain very grateful for GitHub, the package registries, and all the goodies they can find in them.  The prospect of autonomous battle use tickles our narrative drive.  But there's every reason to believe mass analysis on social media, voice-rec on radio, and image-rec on satellite occurred to NATO military intelligence on both sides long before [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/tag/tools/) got in the game for Ukraine.  Russia has [satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(satellite)), too, of course.  Not to mention intelligence and propaganda operations.

Nothing new here, of course.  Giving software to everyone has long meant giving it also to the Kims of North Korea, the Al-Assads of Syria, the Apartheid regime of South Africa earlier on in software history.  Global public distribution has long conflicted in principle with [arms control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography_from_the_United_States), [sanctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_during_apartheid), and other alternatives to military conflict that rely on cooperation.

The difference lies in how easy it is, emotionally and analytically, to avoid this issue or explain it away.  Pretty easy for Americans in the middle '90s with the USSR fallen, their nukes secure, and the US economy booming, its homeland undisturbed.  Not so easy with Iranian drones flying over the Dnieper, Korean drones flying over the demilitarized zone, Korean missiles flying over Japan, Chinese jets flying over Taiwan, and Ukraine making the news every day.

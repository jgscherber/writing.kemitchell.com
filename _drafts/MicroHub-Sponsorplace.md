[LibreOffice is for sale on the Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/libreoffice/9PB80DCFP83W), proceeds to [The Document Foundation](https://www.documentfoundation.org/).  Net of Redmond's take, I presume.

There has already been a [related kerfuffle](https://www.pcgamer.com/microsoft-store-u-turn-open-source/).  Best I can tell, the Microsoft part of Microsoft, which runs the Store, became alarmed at the laundering of open source as paid apps over its counter.  Their policy response, predictably overbroad, banned putting prices on free open source, predictably prompting [concerned outcry](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2022/jul/07/microsoft-bans-commerical-open-source-in-app-store/) from stewards of projects who would beg that way.  Mostly I think this served to raise awareness that selling open source through apps stores is a thing to be done these days, even in Windows Land.

Fitzgerald wrote that "the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function."  I suspect this quote endures because it flatters.  Orwell also extolled the knack "to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them".  He dubbed it "doublethink".  It's hardly flattering, so I suspect it endures because for being all too true.

On the one hand, software, or at least

Coders of the '90s and 2000s brought software dist and dev online.  Open source gave them a story, jargon, heroes, allies, and enemies---a way to see the software world.  They won some recognition.  But their program left funding and payoff to industry and the academy.  They made their money in meatspace, when they needed to make money at all.

The early Web did not do payments.  It barely did access control.  Naturally, its conjoined ideology, freedom of information, made gating access or permission on payment taboo.  Gating software meant preventing copies, handling money, or both.  Either was awkward or impossible in practice.  So open source them unnecessary.

Even with PayPal, eBay, Amazon, and Transport Layer Security in the late 1990s, it took years for Americans to trust their money to the Net.  Open source, like the Web that coevolved it, moved furthest and spread fastest by leveraging what it had as it shipped.  This was the land-grab stage, for installed base and mindshare.  Feature fights came later.

We're well past that now.  Today's Internet people grow up on a more complete Web.  It does a lot more, for a whole lot more people.  Public calls to pay are as common online as in real life.

It's not just ads, like in the early days.  The very words "platform" and "marketplace" are merging.  If you make stuff on the Internet for others today, chances are good your distributor also wants to be your payment processor.  They pave a path for going pro.  They often facilitate segmenting free from premium, then "monetizing" one or both.

Then there's open source.  The paved path for open source is an off-ramp: go make money doing something, anything, else.  One rule for the Internet, and another for software.  And not even all of software.

Even software components around older industries, like games, music, or manufacturing, don't suffer this exceptionalism.  Nor, of course, do most consumer apps.  Outside open source, there's often not just a market, but competing software marketplaces, angling to bring more buyers and showcase more seller success.  The less advantaged a seller, the more appealing their story.  [Horatio Alger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Alger) again.

GitHub launched a software marketplace five years ago...[for GitHub integrations](https://github.blog/2017-05-22-introducing-github-marketplace-and-more-tools-to-customize-your-workflow/).  A month later, they hosted the first [Sustain](https://sustainoss.org/assets/pdf/SustainOSS-west-2017-report.pdf).  After two years, [joining the Borg](https://news.microsoft.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-to-acquire-github-for-7-5-billion/), and another Sustain, they didn't open Marketplace to the rest of software as we know it.  They [first-partied donations](https://github.blog/2019-05-23-announcing-github-sponsors-a-new-way-to-contribute-to-open-source/), then literally threw [free](https://docs.github.com/en/sponsors/getting-started-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors#about-the-github-sponsors-matching-fund) [money](https://docs.github.com/en/sponsors/getting-started-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors#about-github-sponsors) at it, to close the [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com)-[Open Collective](https://www.opencollective.com) gap.

For what GitHub does, there's a market.  For what we do on GitHub, a tip jar.

Donations, in a word, are weak.  They excel in just one way: offending almost no one.   As long as you don't beg too often.  As long as you don't beg too loud.

GitHub does donation as a button with a heart on it.  The button resides in a sidebar, often below the fold.  The button is gray.  Very weak.  Very safe.

Even with optimized appeals and big, shiny "calls to action", tips brings less than payments for good or service.  So it takes a much bigger audience to yield to make meaningful cash.  So fewer people do.  This is a problem when competing as a platform means showing off successes.

Owning distribution, GitHub can mint new celebrities.  Celebrity increases audience, which helps low-yield donations add up.  Of course, successful celebrities also promote the platform.  Careful choice of stars and starlets can bolster its image.  But there can only be so many.  If everyone's famous, even just coder-famous, then no one is.

Like the patronage platforms it cloned, GitHub Sponsors quietly morphs into a market.  The lead offering is ads, in the form of logo placements.  Largely in `README` and on Pages sites, where they [tend less to offend](https://feross.org/funding-experiment-recap/).  But wherever perks of sponsorship overlap with open expectations---access to code, availability of support, roadmap steering---they're hidden from view.  [Paid private repos.  Members-only forums.](https://github.blog/2022-02-02-new-sponsors-only-repositories-custom-amounts-and-more/)  You might use GitHub daily and not have noticed these exist.  How would you?

Microsoft paid $7.5 billion for the hub of public software distribution and development.  They want to be the payment rail of public software, too.  But money for the kind of software GitHub hosts remains stubbornly verboten.  What's a platform preaching open source to do?  [Integrate with the Microsoft Store?](https://www.pcgamer.com/microsoft-store-u-turn-open-source/)

There's no legal, technical, or business reason not to.  Just a conceptual one.  Which is to say, not much of one.

Coders of the '90s and 2000s brought software distribution and development online.  Open source gave them a story, jargon, heroes, allies, and enemies---a way to see and relate to the software world.  They congealed into a kind of movement, and that movement won recognition.  But they left money to industry and the academy.  They made their payoffs and funded their projects in meatspace, when they decided they needed money at all.

The early Web did not do payments.  It barely did access control.  Naturally, the ideology it selected, freedom of information, made gating access or permission taboo.  Gating software meant preventing copies, taking money, or both.  Either was awkward or impossible in practice.  Ascendant theory made them unnecessary.

Even with PayPal, eBay, Amazon, and Transport Layer Security in the late 1990s, it took years for Americans to trust the Net with their dollars.  Open source, like the Web that coevolved it, moved furthest and spread fastest by leveraging what had already shipped.  This was the land-grab stage, for installed base as for mindshare.  Feature fights came later.

We're past that now.  Today's Internet people grow up on a more complete Web.  It does a lot more, for a whole lot more people, across a whole lot more countries.  Locked doors and price tags are as common online as in real life.  The electronic frontier's been settled.

It's not just ads, as in the early days.  The very words "platform" and "marketplace" are merging.  If you make stuff on the Internet for others today, chances are good your distributor also wants to be your payment processor.  They pave a path for going pro.  Features of their platform facilitate segmenting your free, which contributes more to growing their platform, from your premium, for which you pay them a cut.  Features may help "monetizing" either or both.

Then there's software.  The paved path for software made in public for other software people is an off-ramp: go make money doing something, literally anything, other than charging for it.

Software components from older industries, like entertainment or manufacturing, don't suffer this exceptionalism.  Nor, of course, do most complete apps.  Outside open source, there's often not just a market but competing software marketplaces, angling to bring in more buyers and showcase more seller success.  The less advantaged a seller, the more appealing their story, Ã  la  [Horatio Alger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Alger).

GitHub launched a software marketplace five years ago...[for GitHub integrations](https://github.blog/2017-05-22-introducing-github-marketplace-and-more-tools-to-customize-your-workflow/).  A month later, they hosted the first [Sustain](https://sustainoss.org/assets/pdf/SustainOSS-west-2017-report.pdf), a conference about "sustainability".  After two years, [joining the Borg](https://news.microsoft.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-to-acquire-github-for-7-5-billion/), and another Sustain, they didn't open Marketplace to the rest of software on GitHub.  They [first-partied donation](https://github.blog/2019-05-23-announcing-github-sponsors-a-new-way-to-contribute-to-open-source/), then literally threw [free](https://docs.github.com/en/sponsors/getting-started-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors#about-the-github-sponsors-matching-fund) [money](https://docs.github.com/en/sponsors/getting-started-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors#about-github-sponsors) at it, to close the [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com)-[Open Collective](https://www.opencollective.com) gap.

For what GitHub does, there's a market.  For what we do on GitHub, a tip jar.

Donations, in a word, are weak.  They excel in just one way: offending almost no one.  As long as you don't beg too often.  As long as you don't beg too loud.

GitHub does donation as a button with a heart on it.  The button resides in a sidebar, often below the fold.  The button is gray.  Very weak.  Very safe.

Even with optimized appeals and big, shiny "calls to action", tips brings less than payments for good or service.  So it takes a bigger audience to yield to make meaningful cash.  Fewer people do.  This is a problem when competing as a platform means showcasing success.

Owning distribution, GitHub can mint new celebrities.  Celebrity boosts audience, which helps low-yield donations add up and cross the line.  Of course, successful celebrities also shine light back on the platform.  The right choice of stars and starlets can brighten its image.  But there can only be so many notables.  If everyone's famous, even just coder-famous, then no one is.

Like the patronage platforms it cloned, GitHub Sponsors quietly morphs into a market.  The lead offering is ads, in the form of logo placements.  Largely in `README` and on Pages sites, where they [tend less to offend](https://feross.org/funding-experiment-recap/).  But wherever perks of sponsorship cross with open expectations---access to code, availability of support, roadmap steering---they're hidden from view.  [Paid private repos.  Members-only forums.](https://github.blog/2022-02-02-new-sponsors-only-repositories-custom-amounts-and-more/)  You might use GitHub daily and not have noticed these things can now be gated.

Microsoft paid $7.5 billion for the hub of public software distribution and development.  They want to be the payment rail of public software, too.  But money for the kind of software GitHub hosts remains stubbornly, culturally taboo.  What's a platform preaching open source to do?  [Integrate with the Microsoft Store?](https://www.pcgamer.com/microsoft-store-u-turn-open-source/)

This is already happening.  [LibreOffice is for sale](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/libreoffice/9PB80DCFP83W), proceeds to [The Document Foundation](https://www.documentfoundation.org/).  Net of Redmond's take, I presume.

There has already been a [related kerfuffle](https://www.pcgamer.com/microsoft-store-u-turn-open-source/).  Best I can tell, Microsoft became alarmed at the "laundering" of open source code as paid apps over its counter by non-contributors.  Their policy response, predictably overbroad, banned putting prices on free open source.  This prompted [equally predictable outcry](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2022/jul/07/microsoft-bans-commerical-open-source-in-app-store/) from stewards of projects of the older school.

Mostly I think this served to raise awareness that selling open source through apps stores is a thing to be done in 2022.  Even in Windows Land.

There's no legal, technical, or business reason not to.  Just a conceptual one.  Which is to say, not much of one.

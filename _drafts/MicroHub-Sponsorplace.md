Coders of the '90s and 2000s brought software distribution and development online.  Open source gave them a story, jargon, heroes, allies, and enemies---a way to see the software world.  They became a kind of movement, and that movement won recognition.  But their thinking left money to industry and the academy.  They made their payoffs and funded their projects in meatspace, when they needed money at all.

The early Web did not do payments.  It barely did access control.  Naturally, the ideology it selected, freedom of information, made gating access or permission taboo.  Gating meant preventing copies, taking money, or both.  Either was awkward or impossible in practice.  Popular theory made them unnecessary, undesirable.

Even with eBay, Amazon, PayPal, and Transport Layer Security in the late 1990s, it took years for Americans to trust the Net with their money.  Meanwhile, open source, like the Web that grew up with it, moved furthest and spread fastest by leveraging what had already shipped.  This was the land-grab stage, for installed base and for mindshare.  Feature fights came later.

We're past that now.  Today's Internet people grow up on a more complete Web.  It does a lot more, for a whole lot more people, across a whole lot more countries.  Locked doors and price tags are as common online as in real life.  The electronic frontier has been civilized, such as that goes.

It's not just ads, like in the good old days.  Networks became platforms and platforms become marketplaces.  If you make digital stuff on the Internet today, chances are good your distributor also wants to be your payment processor.  They pave a path to going pro.  Features facilitate segmenting your free from your premium, the former growing their platform, the latter paying a cut.  They've tools to help you "monetize" one segment or both.

Then there's software.  The paved path for public software is an off-ramp: go make money doing something, literally anything, but charging for it.  That which is public must remain open, and that which is open must remain pure.

Software components from older industries, like entertainment or manufacturing, don't persist this exceptionalism.  Nor, of course, do most complete apps.  Outside open source, there's often not just a market but competing marketplaces, angling to bring in more buyers and showcase more success.  The less advantaged a seller, the more appealing their rise.  [Horatio Alger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Alger) all over again.

GitHub launched a software marketplace five years ago...[for GitHub integrations](https://github.blog/2017-05-22-introducing-github-marketplace-and-more-tools-to-customize-your-workflow/).  A month later, they hosted the first [Sustain](https://sustainoss.org/assets/pdf/SustainOSS-west-2017-report.pdf), a kind of support group for maintainer types.  After two years, [joining the Borg](https://news.microsoft.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-to-acquire-github-for-7-5-billion/), and another Sustain, they didn't open Marketplace to the rest of software on GitHub.  They [first-partied donation](https://github.blog/2019-05-23-announcing-github-sponsors-a-new-way-to-contribute-to-open-source/), then literally threw [free](https://docs.github.com/en/sponsors/getting-started-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors#about-the-github-sponsors-matching-fund) [money](https://docs.github.com/en/sponsors/getting-started-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors#about-github-sponsors) at it, to close the [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com)-[Open Collective](https://www.opencollective.com) signup gap.

For what GitHub does, there's a market.  For what we do on GitHub, a tip jar.

Donations, in a word, are weak.  They excel in just one way: offending almost no one.  As long as you don't beg too often.  As long as you don't beg too loud.

GitHub does donation as a button with a heart on it.  The button resides in a sidebar, often below the fold.  The button is gray.  Theme gray.  Very weak.  Very safe.

Even with optimized appeals and big, shiny "calls to action", tips brings less than payments for good or service.  So it takes a bigger audience to yield meaningful cash.  Fewer people do.  This is a problem when competing as a platform means showcasing success.

Owning distribution, GitHub can scout the field and mint celebrities.  Celebrity boosts audience, which helps low-yield donations add up and cross the line.  Of course, successful celebrities also shine light back on the platform.  The [right choice of stars and starlets](https://stars.github.com/) can burnish its image.  But there can only be so many notables.  If everyone's famous, even just coder-famous, then no one is.

Like the patronage platforms it cloned, GitHub Sponsors quietly morphs into a market.  The lead offering is ads, in the form of logo placements.  Largely in `README` and on Pages sites, where they [tend less to offend](https://feross.org/funding-experiment-recap/).  This is the go-to monetize model for the free in freemium.

But wherever perks of sponsorship cross open expectations---access to code, availability of support, roadmap steering---they're hidden from view.  [Paid private repos.  Members-only forums.](https://github.blog/2022-02-02-new-sponsors-only-repositories-custom-amounts-and-more/)  You might use GitHub daily and never have noticed these are a thing.  There isn't just public GitHub and private GitHub.  There are paid gates between them, dubbed "sponsorship", but actually exchange.

Microsoft paid $7.5 billion for the hub of public software distribution and development.  They want to be the payment rail of public software, too.  But money for the kind of software public GitHub hosts remains stubbornly, culturally taboo.  What's a platform preaching open source to do?  [Integrate with the Microsoft Store?](https://www.pcgamer.com/microsoft-store-u-turn-open-source/)

Already happening.  [LibreOffice is for sale](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/libreoffice/9PB80DCFP83W), proceeds to [The Document Foundation](https://www.documentfoundation.org/).  Net of Redmond's cut, I presume.

There has also been a [related kerfuffle](https://www.pcgamer.com/microsoft-store-u-turn-open-source/).  Enterprising nobodies were offering open source for sale on their app store.  Microsoft became alarmed and overreacted, banning sales of open source.  Cue [predictable outcry](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2022/jul/07/microsoft-bans-commerical-open-source-in-app-store/) from stewards and developers actually using this to ask money for their projects.  Call it "sales", but isn't this mostly sponsorship?  How much are people paying for the convenience of one-click installation, and how much in support?  Who really wants to know?

I have grave concerns about the dominance of GitHub under Microsoft.  But I'm not sure any of this is bad, at least not yet.  Nature abhors hard, sharp categories.  The lines between and around public and private, open and closed have always been blurry, sharpened mostly by our preference to see things that way.  More monetization methods enable more projects to thrive and more developers to strike out.

Getting those methods implemented and socialized is a boon to software.  Nobody's better positioned to socialize right now than Microsoft.  But nobody's better positioned to dominate, either.

The most obvious moat, to my eye, is the payment network.  If every company's set up to pay for GitHub and every developer's set up for Sponsors or Marketplace, the network effect will be a lot like AWS.  Companies could end up handling dev payroll through GitHub.

I'll also be keeping an eye out for administrative infrastructure moves.  They already manage installation through the Microsoft Store.  We could seem something like [Windows Installer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Installer) over [InstallShield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InstallShield) and [WISE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wise_Solutions), coupled with a [Tidelift-style](https://tidelift.com/subscription/how-to-connect-tidelift-with-github) usage tracker spanning language environments, for servers, workstations, and perhaps even mobile.  They are definitely still in the running to be preferred solution for [SBOMs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/).

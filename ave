[38;2;255;255;255mThe software-security problem is a product-service quality problem.  Much as drivers need reliable cars and everyone wants competent dentistry, users need and want secure software.  Trouble is, consumers can't tell on their own, in a hurry, if a particular car is a lemon, a particular dentist's a dunce, or some piece of software's full of holes.[0m

Not just among vendors and customers, but among vendors' vendors and customers' customers, however many there may be.[0m[48;2;63;0;1m[0K[0m

[48;2;63;0;1mThis general problem has a general solution: legally enforceable promises from vendors to customers to cover them financially when expectations aren't met.  In legal terms, "warranties" and "indemnities".  Developers can promise users [48;2;144;16;17mthat [48;2;63;0;1mthey'll make them whole when vulns or breaches cause harm.

[38;2;255;255;255mWarranties and indemnities for security encode security signals in price.  If users demand more security---higher limits, broader coverage---they negotiate better terms and pay more for them.  The vendors, receiving the money, can better afford to supply it.  If they fail to invest proportionately and effectively, they can end up sending money back to customers for the consequences.[0m

Making basic balloon animals that kids love is a lot easier than most people think.  They key is good balloons.

If you get balloons designed to stand up to basic twisting, some will still pop here and there.  But it will go from discouragingly often to tolerably rare.

## Step 1: Acquire Basic Supplies

1.  Balloons

    Buy an assorted color bag of [Qualatex](https://us.qualatex.com/) size 260Q balloons.  I get mine [on eBay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=qualatex+260+assortment+bag).

    Try to buy from a seller that looks like they sell a lot of balloons.  You can keep your balloons for years, but if you get old ones that have been on some warehouse shelf for years to start, you might have a harder time.

    For folks outside North America, I have read, but not tested, that [Sempertex](https://www.sempertext.com), based in Columbia, also makes good twisting balloons.  I've also read that [Betallatex](https://www.betallic.com), out of St. Louis, makes good ones.  But I haven't tried them.

2.  Pump

    Buy whatever full-size, manual, double-action balloon pump Qualatex makes.

    Here is the one I have:

    Consider getting two---one for you, one for any precocious kid that wants to try.

    I do _not_ recommend the "pocket pump" Qualatex offers.  It's much slower, harder to hold, and mine blew a gasket after a year.

4.  Permanent Marker

    A single medium, black Sharpie marker or similar will do.  Mostly for drawing eyes and animal spots.

5.  Apron

    If you see yourself standing up or moving around as you twist, get yourself a half- or waist-apron with big front pockets, like restaurant waitstaff wear, to hold your pumps and balloons.  I fold mine in half, so it's shorter.

## Step 2: Work Through Some Tutorials

Go watch a few videos from [Michael Floyd's "Balloon Animals for Beginners" series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzpMuO1BnJQ&list=PLkbFkY1_qG3jGNHOFlSxXBpgreM5ChyAq).  Start from the beginning.  Learning to tie off might be the hardest part.

  Michael's a pro.  He inflates with his mouth.  Don't expect to be able to do that without a lot of practice.  Use your pump.

If you take to twisting, make sure you watch through [his "Ask the Balloon Guy" series, too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbCs5qYOCQ&list=PLkbFkY1_qG3hC7IFVxCev8XISEhDksQi9)  Lots of great tips.

## Step 3: Go For It

You can entertain a whole kids' party for hours just making noodles, swords, and hats.  If you can make a dog, you're more than ready.

## Step 4: Understand the Act

I'm not sure if I heard this first from Michael or from someone else.  But I've definitely found it to be true:

- The youngest kids really just want attention and a balloon.  The simplest shapes, presented in a personal way, will make them very happy.  Let them pick the color.

- Older kids want to be impressed, or to get a balloon they can impress their friends with.

- Adults with kids want their kids happy.

- Adults without kids want a laugh.

## Step 5: Strategize a Little

You can't stop balloons popping once you've handed them over.  But if you're working with kids particularly given to startle and cry, avoid shapes with pinch twists or pulls through, like one-balloon teddy bears and frogs.  Avoid orange balloons.
